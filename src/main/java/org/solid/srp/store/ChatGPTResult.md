The code exhibits **some aspects** of the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, **encapsulation**, and **loose coupling**, but there are areas where it could be improved to fully adhere to these principles. Let’s analyze each principle in detail:

---

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change. Each class should focus on a single responsibility.

#### **Adherence in the Code**
- **ShoppingCart**:
    - Handles cart-related operations like adding items, removing items, and purchasing items. ✅
    - It does not directly modify stock, which is good for SRP.
- **Stock**:
    - Manages inventory items and operations like adding stock, modifying availability, and listing items. ✅
- **OperationList**:
    - Encapsulates common operations on lists, such as adding, removing, and searching for items. ✅
    - However, its utility nature might mix responsibilities if extended beyond list operations.
- **Item**:
    - Represents an individual item with attributes (code, price, quantity) and manages its own state, like availability or quantity changes. ✅

#### **Violations**
1. **ShoppingCart**:
    - Prints log messages directly using `System.out.println()`. Logging should be handled by a dedicated logger or logging class to separate concerns.
2. **OperationList**:
    - The `remove()` method is unclear in its behavior when an item is not found, as it returns `null`. This could lead to confusion or runtime issues.

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**
- **Extract Logging**: Use a logger (like `java.util.logging`) for logging purposes instead of directly printing to the console.
- **OperationList Responsibilities**: Ensure `OperationList` focuses only on utility methods for list operations. Avoid extending its scope further.

---

### **2. Encapsulation**

**Definition**: Data and methods that operate on the data should be grouped together, and implementation details should be hidden.

#### **Adherence in the Code**
- **Encapsulated Fields**:
    - The `Item` class encapsulates its attributes (`code`, `price`, `quantity`, `available`) and provides getter methods to access them. ✅
- **Controlled Access**:
    - Classes like `ShoppingCart` and `Stock` use public methods to expose functionality while hiding internal details (e.g., the `cartItems` and `stockItems` lists are private). ✅

#### **Violations**
1. Direct Access to `stockItems` in `ShoppingCart`:
    - The `ShoppingCart` class directly accesses `Stock`'s internal `items` list (`this.stockItems = stock.items`), which exposes internal implementation details of `Stock`. This violates encapsulation.
2. No Validation in Setters:
    - While the code does not include setters, if they are added, validation for attributes (e.g., non-negative quantity) should be implemented to ensure encapsulation integrity.

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**
- **Encapsulate Stock Items**: Expose a method like `getItems()` in `Stock` to provide a read-only view of items instead of directly exposing the list.
- **Immutable Items**: Consider making `Item` immutable by removing setters and using constructor-based initialization for all fields. Use methods to change the state (e.g., `increaseQuantity()`).

---

### **3. Loose Coupling**

**Definition**: Classes should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, minimizing interdependencies.

#### **Adherence in the Code**
- **Separation of Concerns**:
    - `ShoppingCart` depends on `Stock` but does not tightly couple with its internal logic. It interacts only with the items provided by `Stock`. ✅
- **Independent Responsibilities**:
    - The `Item` class is independent and does not depend on other classes. ✅

#### **Violations**
1. **Direct Dependency on List Implementation**:
    - Classes like `OperationList` assume that items are stored in a `List`. This creates a tight coupling with the specific collection type.
2. **No Abstraction**:
    - The `ShoppingCart` and `Stock` classes directly work with the `Item` class and lists, which could make it harder to replace or extend functionality (e.g., switching to a database for item storage).

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**
- **Use Interfaces or Abstract Classes**:
    - Introduce an interface like `ItemRepository` for managing items. For example, `ShoppingCart` could depend on an interface for stock instead of directly using `Stock`:
      ```java
      public interface StockInterface {
          List<Item> getAvailableItems();
      }
      ```
- **Dependency Injection**:
    - Inject dependencies into classes rather than creating them internally. For example, pass a `Logger` or `Stock` dependency into `ShoppingCart` through its constructor.

---

### **Proposed Changes for Better Adherence**

Here’s how the code could be improved:

1. **Encapsulation**:
    - Change `ShoppingCart` to fetch items via a method in `Stock`:
      ```java
      public ShoppingCart(Stock stock) {
          this.cartItems = new ArrayList<>();
          this.stockItems = stock.getItems(); // Use a getter instead of direct access
      }
      ```

2. **Loose Coupling**:
    - Create an `ItemRepository` interface and implement it in `Stock`:
      ```java
      public interface ItemRepository {
          List<Item> getAvailableItems();
      }
      ```

    - Update `ShoppingCart` to depend on `ItemRepository`:
      ```java
      public ShoppingCart(ItemRepository repository) {
          this.cartItems = new ArrayList<>();
          this.stockItems = repository.getAvailableItems();
      }
      ```

3. **Logging**:
    - Replace `System.out.println` with a logger:
      ```java
      private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(ShoppingCart.class.getName());
      ```

### Final Assessment

The code has **some alignment** with the principles of SRP, encapsulation, and loose coupling, but improvements are necessary:

- **SRP**: Good separation of concerns, but logging and operations can be better isolated.
- **Encapsulation**: Mostly well-done, but direct access to internal fields (like `stockItems`) needs improvement.
- **Loose Coupling**: Needs work, especially by introducing interfaces and abstracting dependencies.

Refactoring the code to address these areas will make it more maintainable, modular, and scalable.

Here’s your **grading breakdown from 10 for each principle**, along with explanations:

---

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
**Grade**: **7/10**
- **Why?**
    - The `ShoppingCart` and `Item` classes mostly adhere to SRP.
    - However, `Stock` mixes concerns by managing inventory and modifying item availability.
    - `OperationList` lacks focus, handling unrelated operations like adding, searching, and removing items in a generic and error-prone way.

- **Improvements Needed**:
    - Refactor `Stock` to separate inventory and availability logic.
    - Divide `OperationList` into smaller, purpose-specific utility classes.

---

### **2. Encapsulation**
**Grade**: **6/10**
- **Why?**
    - The `Item` class is well-encapsulated with private fields and appropriate getters/setters.
    - `ShoppingCart` hides its internal state (`cartItems`), which is good.
    - **Issue**: The `Stock` class directly exposes its `items` list, violating encapsulation.
    - `OperationList` methods directly manipulate lists passed to them, creating unsafe behavior.

- **Improvements Needed**:
    - Replace direct access to the `items` list in `Stock` with controlled getters (e.g., returning a copy).
    - Refactor `OperationList` to avoid direct list manipulation (e.g., use streams or return modified copies).

---

### **3. Loose Coupling**
**Grade**: **5/10**
- **Why?**
    - `ShoppingCart` is tightly coupled to `Stock` and relies on its concrete implementation.
    - There’s no abstraction to allow swapping out `Stock` with another inventory system (e.g., database-backed).
    - `OperationList` methods depend on `Item` objects, reducing flexibility.

- **Improvements Needed**:
    - Introduce an interface or abstraction for `Stock`, such as `StockInterface`.
    - Refactor `ShoppingCart` to depend on the interface instead of the concrete class.
    - Make `OperationList` more generic by accepting functional arguments or supporting polymorphism.

---

### **4. Reusability**
**Grade**: **7/10**
- **Why?**
    - The `Item` class is reusable and encapsulated.
    - The `OperationList` class provides generic methods like `search()` and `addItem()`, which are good for reusability.
    - **Issue**: The `remove()` method causes runtime exceptions (`ConcurrentModificationException`) and isn’t robust for reuse.

- **Improvements Needed**:
    - Fix the `remove()` method to iterate safely or return a new list.
    - Abstract shared functionality in `Stock` and `ShoppingCart` to enable code reuse across different inventory systems.

### **Final Score**
| **Principle**           | **Grade (out of 10)** | **Reason**                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Single Responsibility** | **7/10**             | Clear separation of some responsibilities, but overlaps exist in `Stock` and `OperationList`.    |
| **Encapsulation**        | **6/10**             | Good in `Item` and `ShoppingCart`, but violated in `Stock` and `OperationList`.                 |
| **Loose Coupling**        | **5/10**             | Tightly coupled `ShoppingCart` and `Stock`; lacks abstraction.                                   |
| **Reusability**           | **7/10**             | Reusable `Item` class and utility methods, but unsafe behaviors in `OperationList`.             |

**Total**: **25/40** = **6.25/10**

### **Suggestions for Improvement**
To bring your score closer to 10:
1. Refactor `Stock` and introduce interfaces for better decoupling.
2. Fix unsafe list operations in `OperationList` (e.g., avoid modifying lists during iteration).
3. Modularize utility functions and separate responsibilities.
4. Enhance encapsulation in `Stock` by hiding internal data and exposing controlled methods.
